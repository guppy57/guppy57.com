              I&apos;m Armaan Gupta. I live in Ames, IA, where I build beautiful
              software for humans.
            </h1>
            <div className="mt-6 space-y-7 text-base text-zinc-600 dark:text-zinc-400">
              <p>
                I&apos;ve been an entreprenuer since I was in elementary school
                when I started selling pens and pencils to fellow students. In
                middle school, I pivoted to selling second hand iPhones to kids
                who got theirs taken away. After that, I discovered how to make
                music with a Digital Audio Workstation (DAW) and started selling
                beats online. After that, I opened a failed gaming studio with a
                friend from my boy scout troop and a game developer in Romania I
                met on Reddit.
              </p>
              <p>
                Yet, near the end of high school, I found a bit of my stride:
                hackathons. After attending one on my own, I fell in love with
                the environment and connecting with fellow makers. So I decided
                to get into the hackathon business.
              </p>
              <p>
                In 2019, I ran my first event, BuildChicago, bringing together
                75 students from across the Chicagoland area. After that ended,
                I consulted on a few more hackathons and started working on four
                more across the nation. My business, Kreative, and the hackathon
                management subsidiary, Kreative Horizon, was going to bring over
                500 students together.
              </p>
              <p>
                Then COVID-19 came knocking. I had to shut down all of my events
                and pivotted to building beautiful websites for small businesses
                with my business Kreative Dreamflow. Today, I student Management
                Information Systems at Iowa State University (graduating in
                2024). In addition, I continue to run Kreative Dreamflow and am
                launching new hackathons in the greater Des Moines area. Plus, I
                work as a Software Engineer at John Deere with fellow ISU and
                UIUC students.
              </p>
              <p>
                Life&apos;s good and I&apos;m excited to continue to build
                useful and beautiful things for humans.
